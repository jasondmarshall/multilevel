# multilevel
The R scripts included within this repository are intended to aid in your learning of multilevel modeling in R.

These files were originally created to facilitate a workshop conducted for The PhD Project's Management Doctoral Student Association (MDSA). The Multilevel-R-Markdown-v2.html file and the RCM Growth Modeling - Bliese's Steps.R script are intended to augment Bliese's (2016) multilevel package tutorial document (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multilevel/multilevel.pdf). The Sample_RCM_GROWTH_Stress_Mindset.R script was developed for one of our publications (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19325037.2020.1767002) and is shared here to help individuals learn how to create construct-level data from item-level data, calculate Cronbach alphas, create a correlation table, and step-by-step work through RCM growth modeling.
